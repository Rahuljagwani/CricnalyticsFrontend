We’ve always heard experts talk about how a batsman is more powerful than the others. How he’s middling the ball and hitting the sweet spot consistently. But what does all of that really mean in numbers? This is used by teams to make accurate decisions about a game that is generally considered as unpredictable.</p><p>We here at CRICNALYTICS (CRICKET+ANALYTICS) have such visions for this website where we provided you statistical analysis of the players in the various fields of cricket. Use the navigation bar to navigate through miscellaneous data analysed by our very own experts.</p></div></>);
